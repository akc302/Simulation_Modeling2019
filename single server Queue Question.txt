SSQ : 

1. Use FIFO , LIFO , SJF and find the following performace metrices using n = 6 , pa = 0.2 , ps = 0.3 :

i.  Average Delay, E[D]
ii. Expected Number of Customers in Queue, E[Q]
ii. Utilization of the Server, E[U]

2. Find which one performs better from step-1? [FIFO , LIFO , SJF]

3. You have to generate 6 graphs . 

arrival rate vs E[D] : n = 50,100 and Queue discipline in task - 2 ;

n = 50 , Queue = FIFO 
x-axis : different arrival rates ;
y - axis : average delays for the arrival rates ;

n = 100 , Queue = FIFO 
x-axis : different arrival rates ;
y - axis : average delays for the arrival rates ;


arrival rate vs E[Q] : n = 50,100 and Queue discipline in task - 2 ; 
arrival rate vs E[U] : n = 50,100 and Queue discipline in task - 2 ;
